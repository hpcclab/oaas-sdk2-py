## *Discrption*
In this section, an overview of OaaS-SDK2-PY will be provided, while the details of each individual component will be discussed in separate sections.

The OaaS-SDK2-PY project was designed to offer a Python-based tool for seamless interaction with OaaS. Using this tool, developers can implement classes, create functions, and invoke these functions. 

To provide a comprehensive solution for users by combining a set of requirements into a single tool, several components have been grouped together in OaaS-SDK2-PY. These components include Python libraries, [JSON-based configuration format?], [device agent?], and more. Each component has its own specific purpose and differentiated functionality, with the actual usage of these components spanning the entire process, from the initial step to the final stages or maintenance.

The overall process of OaaS-SDK2-PY can be divided into two parts: Architectural Analysis and Workflow Analysis. The reason for separating these two distinct analyses is that each focuses on a different perspective. Architectural analysis examines the process from the system structure level, while workflow analysis focuses on explaining the overall flow of using OaaS-SDK2-PY from the developer's perspective.

Architectural analysis contains two parts: Control plane and Data plane. Control plane is ---. Data plane is ---.

Regarding the workflow analysis, the usage of OaaS-SDK2-PY to successfully launch a service in OaaS can be divided into three main phases: development, deployment, and invocation. In the development phase, developers write code using the Python API provided by OaaS-SDK2-PY. During this phase, the configuration is also defined to meet the expected requirements.
